## Minimal Configs for Productivity
#### Setup
terminal : rxvt-unicode  
window manager : i3  
shell : zsh  

extras:
- fehbg to assign wallpaper
- picom for i3 transparent background
- xsel for copy paste
- xrdb for urxvt configs

I use nvim and tmux for my workflow.

For arch users just run the link.sh script and reboot. Don't know if it'll work though haven't tested it :P
